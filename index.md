# Run for your Life

There comes a time in everyone's life when they become tired of being sick and tired. Melville calls it the damp November in his soul. While he seeks the sea for solace to his depression, I hit the roads. Running keeps me fit, it releases endorphins, and it gets me away from the monotony of daily life. Sure, there are fitness regimes that could be less time consuming and would be better for the gains, but running is the best.

## How to become a runner?

* Get some decent shoes.
* Put on said decent shoes.
* Go outside and put one foot in front of another.
* Put the other foot in front of the first foot.
* Repeat until you've covered some distance.
* Return to the start.

## How to not be a runner?

Just like any new activity, getting started running can be hard. It's important if you're a runner to make new runners feel welcome and encouraged. Here's some things to avoid.

* NO MANSPLAINING (see the point above)
* Don't make a hierarchy between running and jogging.
* Spitting/snot rocket is fine, but watch out for people behind you.
